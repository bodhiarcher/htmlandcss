Centering
Centering content with CSS is a core required skill if you want to become a web developer. 
Some content is easier to center, while some require more thinking and CSS knowledge.

Horizontal Centering
How can we center a block element horizontally? Setting the value auto for the left and right margin will center any block level element.
In order to center inline-block elements, we need to add the text-align property to the parent of the inline-block. 
The text-align property is used for aligning the text, but it can be used in this case as well.
These are all static positioned elements. But what about relative or absolute positioned elements? 
Relative elements do not have major differences. 
Let’s look at the same example for a block-level element, but this time let’s add relative position:

But for absolute positioned elements, we need to set the left and right property along with the auto property for margin-left and margin-right
Vertical centering is a bit trickier. Let’s assume we want to center a div. There is a CSS property that can help us achieve our task. 
The transform property with a translateY value will move the element on the Y-axis (Vertical axis) on the screen.
