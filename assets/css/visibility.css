/*CSS visibility Property
Unlike the display property, the visibility property only hides the element. 
It doesnâ€™t remove it from the page. The element is still there in the flow of the page, but hidden. 
It still occupies the space just like any other visible element. The visibility property hides or shows the element. 
Set its value to hidden to hide the targeted content.*/

Example
Make <h2> elements visible and hidden:

h2.a {
  visibility: visible;
}

h2.b {
  visibility: hidden;
}

/*CSS Syntax
visibility: visible|hidden|collapse|initial|inherit;
Property Values
Value	Description	Play it
visible	Default value. The element is visible	
hidden	The element is hidden (but still takes up space)	
collapse	Only for table rows (<tr>), row groups (<tbody>), columns (<col>), column groups (<colgroup>).
This value removes a row or column, but it does not affect the table layout. 
The space taken up by the row or column will be available for other content.
If collapse is used on other elements, it renders as "hidden"

initial	Sets this property to its default value.	
inherit	Inherits this property from its parent element.*/
