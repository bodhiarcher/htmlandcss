/*FONT FAMILY
The font-family property specifies the font for an element.

The font-family property can hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, 
it tries the next font.

There are two types of font family names:
family-name - The name of a font-family, like "times", "courier", "arial", etc.
generic-family - The name of a generic-family, like "serif", "sans-serif", "cursive", "fantasy", "monospace".*/

SYNTAX
font-family: family-name|generic-family|initial|inherit;

family-name generic-family	- A prioritized list of font family names and/or generic family names	
initial	- Sets this property to its default value.
inherit	- Inherits this property from its parent element. 

Start with the font you want, and always end with a generic family, 
to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.

Note: Separate each value with a comma.

Note: If a font name contains white-space, it must be quoted. Single quotes must be used when using the "style" attribute in HTML.
