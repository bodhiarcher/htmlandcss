/*CSS Source Order
When working with CSS, the browser will automatically read from top to bottom. 
Therefore the CSS rules will be applied in the order in which they are declared. 
If we declare a CSS rule twice, then the CSS rule thatâ€™s declared closest to 
the bottom of the file will override the CSS rule that was declared near the top of the file.*/
